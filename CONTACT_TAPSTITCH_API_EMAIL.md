**Subject:** API Access Request for Custom Next.js Integration

**To:** support@tapstitch.com

**Body:**

```
Hello TapStitch Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to request API access for integrating TapStitch with my custom Next.js e-commerce website.

**About My Store:**
- Platform: Next.js (React framework)
- Hosting: Hostinger
- Website: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]
- Contact Email: contact@therealmh5.com
- Use Case: Print-on-demand fulfillment for custom apparel (hoodies, t-shirts, etc.)

**What I Need:**
I'm looking to integrate TapStitch for order fulfillment and would like to access your API to:

1. Sync product catalog from TapStitch to my website
2. Automatically create orders in TapStitch when customers complete checkout
3. Receive order status updates via webhooks (shipped, delivered, etc.)
4. Display product information and pricing on my site

**Specifically, I'm requesting:**
1. API documentation
2. API credentials (API Key, API Secret, or authentication method)
3. Base API URL/endpoints
4. Webhook setup instructions and secret
5. Rate limits and best practices
6. Sample code or SDK (if available)

**My Current Setup:**
- I already have a checkout system integrated with Stripe for payment processing
- After payment is successful, I need to send order details to TapStitch
- I have webhook endpoints ready to receive order status updates

I understand that TapStitch currently has integrations for Shopify, WooCommerce, and other platforms, but I'm building a custom solution and would greatly appreciate API access.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there's a specific application process I should follow.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

[YOUR_PHONE_OPTIONAL]

## If They Don't Offer API Access:

If TapStitch doesn't provide API access for custom integrations, ask about:

1. **Shopify Bridge Solution**: Can you use Shopify as a middle layer?
2. **Manual Import**: Can you export orders and import them manually?
3. **Zapier/Make.com Integration**: Do they have no-code automation tools?
4. **Future API Plans**: When might API access become available?
