**Subject:** API Access Request for Custom Next.js Website Integration

---

Hello TapStitch Team,

I'm building a custom Next.js website for my brand (MH5) and I'd like to integrate TapStitch's print-on-demand services directly into my site. I've heard great things about the quality of your products, particularly your clothing line.

I would like to request:

1. **API Documentation**
   - REST API endpoints and methods
   - Authentication requirements
   - Request/response formats
   - Rate limits

2. **API Credentials**
   - API key and secret (or appropriate authentication method)
   - Webhook secret for order status updates

3. **Integration Details**
   - Product catalog endpoints (to display products on my site)
   - Order creation endpoints (to send orders for fulfillment)
   - Order status tracking endpoints
   - Webhook setup for real-time order updates

4. **Available Products**
   - Product catalog access
   - Pricing information
   - Shipping options and rates

**Use Case:**
- Custom Next.js website (not Shopify)
- Customers will browse products on my site
- Payments will be processed via Stripe
- Orders need to be automatically sent to TapStitch for fulfillment
- Real-time order status updates via webhooks

**Questions:**
- Do you provide direct API access for custom websites?
- Is there any monthly fee or setup cost?
- What are your production and shipping times?
- Are there any minimum order requirements?

Thank you for your time. I'm excited to work with TapStitch and offer your quality products to my customers.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
[Your Phone Number]
