2. **File Extensions:** Some files had duplicate extensions (e.g., `.MOV.mov`) which have been cleaned up
3. **Nested Folder:** Files from the nested "MH5 Media" subfolder have been sorted and organized
4. **Existing Files:** Files that already existed in the public folder were skipped to preserve any manual edits
