### CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY

**Asset Classification Logic:**
- **Basketball:** Identified through high-resolution imagery (123_1.JPEG at 851KB, Instagram-processed files), gameplay-focused video files (large MOV files 13MB+ indicating full-length captures)
- **Event Hostings:** Camera roll naming patterns (IMG_*.HEIC/JPG), medium-sized video files (3-6MB indicating event highlight reels), timestamp clustering (Dec 3, 2024 batch)
- **Past Brand Campaigns:** Co-branded content patterns, partnership-specific file naming conventions, strategic asset placement indicators
- **Media Flyers:** Filtered video files (explicit "filtered-" prefix), promotional graphics (MHF.HEIC likely "MH5" promotional), duplicate filenames indicating version control (92C52557-* 2.JPG)

**Quality Ratings Rationale:**
- **4.0-4.3 (Premium):** High-resolution files, professional capture, optimal for marketing use
- **3.5-3.8 (Standard):** Good quality, may require minor optimization, suitable for most marketing applications
- **3.0-3.5 (Needs Review):** Social media optimized (smaller files), may need upscaling for premium use cases
