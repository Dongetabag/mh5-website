## ⚠️ METHODOLOGY NOTES

### Classification Approach
Due to file naming patterns (UUIDs, hashes, generic IMG_* naming), classification was performed using:
1. **File metadata analysis** (sizes, timestamps, EXIF data when available)
2. **Naming pattern recognition** (filtered-*, IMG_*, numbered sequences)
3. **Contextual inference** (MH5's documented activities: events, basketball content, partnerships)
4. **File size correlation** (large files = professional capture, small files = social optimization)

### Limitations & Recommendations
- **Visual verification recommended:** While systematic analysis was applied, visual review of assets would refine category assignments
- **Future enhancement:** Consider adding metadata tags to assets for faster future audits
- **Category expansion opportunity:** As library grows, consider adding "Behind-the-Scenes", "Community Impact", or "Training/Development" categories
