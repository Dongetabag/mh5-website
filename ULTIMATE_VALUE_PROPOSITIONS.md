### YOUR BRAND. BASKETBALL'S BIRTHPLACE. PROVEN IMPACT.

MH5 delivers what no other platform can: authentic connection to basketball's origin story combined with documented audience engagement that moves the needle for sponsors who value cultural relevance over generic reach.

**Why Springfield Matters (And Why Your C-Suite Will Care)**

Springfield, Massachusetts isn't just our home—it's where Dr. James Naismith hung the first peach basket in 1891, where the Basketball Hall of Fame stands, and where your brand can claim authentic basketball heritage. This isn't marketing copy. It's geographic reality. When you sponsor MH5, your brand doesn't just appear at events—it becomes part of basketball's living history.

**Proof of Production Capability: 23 Event Assets**
