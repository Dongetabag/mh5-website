Ensure the font used for \\\"MH5\\\" is a bold, clean, sans-serif font similar to Oswald to align with the brand aesthetic. Consider testing a slightly larger size to see if it enhances the visual impact without compromising the minimalist feel. The logo should be placed high enough to be visible when the hoodie is zipped or worn open, but not so high that it disappears when the hood is up. No secondary color is recommended for this placement.\",\n  \"alternativePlacements\": [\n    \"Left chest, small (2.5 inches wide).\",\n    \"Right sleeve cuff, small (2 inches wide).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
